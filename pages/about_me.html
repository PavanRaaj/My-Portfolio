        I am very Passionate about coding and solving problems.I usually keep my
        ecosystem filled with humor and joy. I am naturally an introvert, but if
        I get connected with people and start working I can produce miracles.
        Coming to the technical field, I know how to code in 7 Programming
        languages. I've done a project using front end within 100 days. I‘ve
        also done a mini project(Todo App) and a final project(Taxido) using
        Ruby on Rails. Since I’ve learned Ruby on Rails myself within two
        months, I am confident to say I can learn any new language given to me.
